This repository is a collection of example helm charts to deploy Uyuni on Kubernetes clusters.
The rationale behind it is that given all the possible combinations, the official helm chart cannot cover all cases.
These helm charts aim at providing some of the common combinations.

Each folder at this level is a different helm chart with its own README explaining its specific details and uses.
